### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Software Engineer with concentration on the Microsoft Programming Stack. I currently lead technical strategy and architecture for Houston Computer Consulting. I have over 30 years of experience designing and programming solutions for medical, financial, petroleum as well as start-ups in various industries including warehousing, delivery, refining, chemical, power and aerospace. In addition to my capabilities working with technical teams I have a solid background in Design (Graphic Communications) and a long history of internet development using a multitude of strategies and packages.

I cut my teeth on the Altair 8800 my family bought as a kit and assembled. I moved from that to the Z80 (TRS-80) and eventually on to the 6502. I learned ASM and BASIC in all of these processors. After I moved on to the x86 family I spent several years working on software in both Delphi and C/C++ up to the 486 days before taking a short sidebar over to the Motorola 68000, writing ASM on the Atari ST. Eventually explored LINGO! and a few other languages before moving into C# and .Net. I spend most of my time writing Web Apps or C++ IOC projects now.
